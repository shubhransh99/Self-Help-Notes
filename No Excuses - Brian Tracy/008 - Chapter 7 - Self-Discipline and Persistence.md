# Self-Discipline and Courage

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Persistence is self-discipline in action
  - When you go the extra mile and do more than you are paid for or more than is expected, your selfesteem goes up.
  - However, it is not how far you fall that counts, but rather how high you bounce
  - Remember, you are not a victim. You are an adult, and you are in charge of your own life. 
  - To remain optimistic, look for the good in every situation. Seek the valuable lesson in every problem or difficulty
  - In life, it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down. All that matters is how many times you get back up
  - Persistence is self-discipline in action.


- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Take a deep breath, pick up the pieces, and continue onward.


- **Quotes and Anecdotes:**
  - “Beware of endeavoring to become a great man in a hurry. One such attempt in 10,000 may succeed. These are fearful odds.” —BENJAMIN DISRAELI
  - Winners never quit, and quitters never win.
  - “I will lay me down to bleed awhile, and then rise and fight again.”
  - “I am unstoppable.”
  
## Action Exercises:

1. Identify one area in your life in which you need to persist even harder to achieve your goal, and then take action in that area.
2. Identify a goal in your life that you did not accomplish because you failed to persist through to completion. What steps could you take today to succeed in that area?
3. Identify one big goal that you achieved because you persisted and refused to give up, no matter how difficult it became.
4. Decide on your major definite purpose in life, the one goal that, if you achieved it,would have the greatest positive impact on your life.
5. Write down your goal clearly, make a detailed plan of action to accomplish it, and then tell yourself that “failure is not an option.”
6. Make a decision today that you will persist until you succeed, no matter what happens, because “I am unstoppable.”
7. Resolve to set and achieve one important goal, overcoming the inevitable difficulties, problems and setbacks you will experience, and to work at it until you succeed. Repeat this process over and over until persistence becomes a habit.
