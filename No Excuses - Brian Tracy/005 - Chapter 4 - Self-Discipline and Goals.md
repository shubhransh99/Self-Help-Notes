# Self-Discipline and Goals
- **Key Concepts:**
  - The very act of taking the time to decide what you really want in each area of your life can change your life completely
  - The tragedy is that most people think that they already have goals. But what they really have are hopes and wishes
  - writing out your goals guarantees does not success, but rather that it increases the probability of success by ten times
  - Writing is called a “psycho-neuro-motor activity.” The act of writing forces you to think and concentrate.
  - your success mechanism is triggered by a goal
  - human beings are teleological organisms, which simply means that we are purpose driven.
  - when human beings program a goal into their minds, they can then set out without having any idea where they will go or how they will achieve that goal
  - Procrastination is not only the thief of time; it is the thief of life.
  - Your thoughts create the conditions of your life. When you change your thinking, you change your life. Your outer world becomes a mirror-image reflection of your inner world.
