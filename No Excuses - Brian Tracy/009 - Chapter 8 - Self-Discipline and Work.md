## Self-Discipline and Work
- **Key Concepts:**
  - it is through doing your most important tasks that you move onward and upward, quickly and dependably in your career.
  - the most important qualities are
    1. The ability to set priorities and work on high-value tasks; and
    2. The discipline to get the job done quickly and well.
  - According to Robert Half International, the average employee wastes about 50 percent of his or her time on nonwork-related activities
    1. Thirty-seven percent of work time is wasted on idle conversation on personal subjects
    2. The other 13 percent of wasted time is consumed by coming in late or leaving early, by long lunches and coffee breaks, by surfing the Internet, reading the newspaper, or conducting personal business during the day.
  - Hard work on the wrong job can actually sabotage your career.
  - The happiest days you will have at work will be when you are working on those tasks that your boss considers to be most important. 
  - Your job is first, to make yourself valuable, and then to make yourself indispensable to your company
  - The biggest time wasters in the world of work are other people who want to talk with you

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Spend time on high value tasks first
  - Another way for you to double your income is for you to use the “hourly rate” method of calculating your personal value and your time allocation
  - Refuse to do those things that someone else can do at a lower hourly rate than you
  - When a time waster approaches you and says, “Do you have a minute to talk?” you reply by saying, “Yes, but not now. Why don’t we talk at lunchtime, or after work? In the meantime, I have to get this job finished. I have to get back to work.”
  - Whenever you find yourself slowing down on a major task, begin repeating to yourself those magic words, “Back to work!”
  - Learn how to dress for success. 
  - Dress for the job two levels above your current job.

- **Quotes and Anecdotes:**
  - “Leaders aren’t born; they are made. And they are made just like anything else, through hard work. And that’s the price we’ll have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal.” —VINCE LOMBARDI
  - “I’m all caught up. I want more responsibility.”
