## Chapter 1
## Self-Discipline and Success
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Aristotle wrote that the ultimate aim of human life is to be happy
  - It is only the top people in every field who are committed to continuous improvement.
  - the law of cause and effect
  - So if you are not happy with your current “crop,” it is up to you, starting today, to plant a new crop
  - “There are only three requirements for success. First, decide exactly what it is you want in life. Second, determine the price that you are going to have to pay to get the things you want. And third, and this is most important, resolve to pay that price.”
  - Successful people are willing to pay the price
  - become a lifelong student of your craft.
  - What this means is that the greatest reward of success is not the money you make but rather the excellent person you become in the process of striving toward success and exerting self-discipline every time it is required.

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - “How shall we live in order to be happy?”
  - How do you define success? If you could wave a magic wand and make your life perfect in every way, what would it look like?
  - Be into top 20%
  - if you want to achieve success in any area, you must determine how success is achieved in that area and then practice those skills and activities repeatedly until you achieve the same results
  - Learn from the experts. Read their books. Listen to their audio programs. Attend their seminars. 
- **Quotes and Anecdotes:**
  - “The first and best victory is to conquer self.” —PLATO
  - “The elevator to success is out of order, but the stairs are always open.”
  - Anecdote: In our society, the top 20 percent of people earn 80 percent of the money and enjoy 80 percent of the riches and rewards.
  - Anecdote: Fully 85 percent of this new generation of millionaires replied by saying something like “I didn’t have a better education or more intelligence, but I was willing to work harder than anyone else.”
