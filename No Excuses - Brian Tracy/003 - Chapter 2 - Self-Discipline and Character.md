# Self-Discipline and Character
- **Key Concepts:**
  - In a way, integrity is actually the value that guarantees all the other values.
  - It is only when you are under pressure—when you are forced to choose one way or another, to either live consistently with a value or to compromise it—that you demonstrate your true character.
  - Furthermore, since the people you associate with have a major effect on your attitude and personality, you make or break your entire life with the quality of your character—or the lack thereof.
  - The Law of Concentration says that “whatever you dwell upon grows and increases in your life.”
  - exercise your self-discipline and willpower to live your life consistently with those values that you most aspire to be known for, you begin to move rapidly along the path to becoming an excellent person.

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Study the Values You Admire.
  - Looking over your life and history, make a list of the people whom you most admire, and next to their names, write out the virtues or values that they most represent to you.
  - So when you have to make a choice or decision, always ask the magic question, “What’s important here?”
  - Practice the Universal Maxim of Immanuel Kant: “Resolve to behave as though your every act were to become a universal law for all people.”
  - Whenever you slip, whenever you do or say something that is inconsistent with your highest values, immediately “get back on your horse.” Say to yourself, “This is not like me!” and resolve that next time you will do better.

- **Quotes and Anecdotes:**
  - “Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anyone else expects of you. Never excuse yourself. Never pity yourself. Be a hard master to yourself and be lenient to everyone else.” —HENRY WARD BEECHER, NINETEENTH-CENTURY CLERGYMAN
  - “Circumstances do not make the man; they merely reveal him to himself.”
