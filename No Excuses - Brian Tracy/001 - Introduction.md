# Introduction
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Personal responsibility is the foundation of success.
  - No blaming external factors; take ownership of your life.
  - It is self-discipline that enables you to “vote yourself off the Someday island.” It is the key to a great life and, without it, no lasting success is possible.
  - Just as self-discipline is the key to success, the lack of self-discipline is the major cause of failure
  - The Path of Least Resistance & The Expediency Factor
  - self-mastery | self-control | self-denial | delayed gratification
  - Bad habits are easy to form, but hard to live with. Good habits are hard to form, but easy to live with. And as Goethe said

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Look around and ask, “Is there anyone else who has my same excuse who is successful anyway?” if yes, then start grinding
  - In a meal, there is a logical order of dishes, and dessert comes last. First, you eat the main courses and clean your plate; only then do you have dessert.


- **Quotes and Anecdotes:**
  - "There are a thousand excuses for failure but never a good reason." —MARK TWAIN
  - “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”
  - ‘Self-discipline is the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.’
  - “There are 999 other success principles that I have found in my reading and experience, but without self-discipline, none of them work. With self-discipline, they all work.”
  - “successful people make a habit of doing the things that unsuccessful people don’t like to do.”
  - “Everything is hard before it’s easy.”
  - Anecdote: It is not the material things you accomplish or acquire that matter so much as it is the quality of the person you must become to accomplish well above the average.
  - Anecdote: Superior people have the ability to throughout their lives make sacrifices in the short term, both large and small, so as to assure greater results and rewards in the long term.
