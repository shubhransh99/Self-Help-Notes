# Self-Discipline and Courage

- **Key Concepts:**
  - The only difference is that the brave person disciplines himself to confront, deal with, and act in spite of the fear. In contrast, the coward allows himself to be dominated and controlled by the fear
  - It often shuts down the brain and causes the individual to revert to the “fight-or-flight” reaction. 
  - “Fake it until you makeit.”
  - “I can do it!”
  - The Law of Reversibility says that “if you feel a certain way, you will act in a manner consistent with that feeling.”
  - But if you act in a manner consistent with that feeling, even if you don’t feel it, the Law of Reversibility will create the feeling that is consistent with your actions.
  - You develop the courage you desire by disciplining yourself repeatedly to do the thing you fear until that fear eventually disappears and it will.
  - Psychologists have found that certain fears are bundled together in the subconscious mind, like wires on the same circuit. If you can overcome your fears in one of these areas, you will also eliminate other fears on the same circuit.
  - First, you need the courage to launch, to take action, to take a leap of faith
  - The second type of courage that you need is called “courageous patience.”
  - It has been estimated that 99 percent of the things that you worry about never happen. And most of the things that do happen, happen so quickly that you didn’t have time to worry about them in the first place.
  - In the final analysis, the only real cure for fear or worry is disciplined, purposeful action in the
direction of your goals

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - “I can do it!” emphatically whenever you feel afraid for any reason, you can cancel the feeling of “I can’t.”
